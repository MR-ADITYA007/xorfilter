This is a sample text file used for demonstrating substring search.
The goal of this program is to efficiently search patterns using XOR filter.
Data Structures and Algorithms are an important subject in computer science.
The Rabin Karp algorithm is used for exact string matching.
The XOR filter acts as a probabilistic pre-filter to speed up the search.
Example patterns such as abc and def are included in this text file.
This approach helps reduce unnecessary comparisons.
